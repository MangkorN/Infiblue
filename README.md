Executive Summary
______________________

Infiblue is a virtual world that mirrors our real one. As a result, Infiblueâ€™s economy functions just like the real world economy, except it is built on the blockchain. This technology allows players to truly own, buy, and trade cryptocurrency within the game, similar to the mechanisms they use in the real world. Players can earn assets with real economic value by getting a job within the game, buying property, or starting a business. Infiblue is also a SocialFi game, meaning that players can advance within the game and earn rewards by creating and posting content.
